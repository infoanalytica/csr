                <p class="p-size"> What’s the only thing we all have in common? – <b>THE EARTH</b>
<br>Welcome to the third edition of ‘The Imprints,’ our CSR newsletter designed especially for iA employees, our
partners, affiliates, and of course mother Earth.</p>
                <p class="p-size">This edition of ‘The Imprints’ would speak about the drastic environmental changes happening around the world
through human activities, our efforts from the previous month to balance the ecosystem, and our upcoming
initiatives and tie-ups with various NGOs and corporates. We will also highlight the contributions of our employees
and affiliates, who are volunteering and contributing to our efforts in building equitable and sustainable
communities.</p>

                <p class="p-size">The death toll was surrounded for 2,815 and still counting
trees to make way for Metro car shed in Mumbai's Aarey Colony. While green activists have called the Mumbai metro's
move to cut trees, the government justified it by saying that the development is meant for a greater good. Shaina NC, a
leader of the ruling party (BJP), said that "We are taking only two percent of Aarey land and planting over 20,000 trees
across Maharashtra in its lieu,". She also claimed that the project will be sustainable as the CM's office will directly
monitor the saplings and that the government was sure that they would have a 35 percent survival rate. Meanwhile,
prohibitory orders under Section 144 of CrPC imposed in the area near the metro-rail project site in Aarey forest. The
environment conservationists were left chanting the slogan of "Choose Aarey, not concrete Grey!"</p>

                <p class="p-size">Prime Minister Narendra Modi shared a video of him picking up trash on a beach in Tamil
Nadu's Mamallapuram, sending across a strong message to the nation about the importance
of keeping surroundings clean, and highlighting Swacch Bharat Mission, an ambitious
initiative of the ruling government towards a cleaner India. "Plogging at a beach in
Mamallapuram this morning. It lasted for over 30 minutes. I also handed over my 'collection'
to Jeyaraj, who is a part of the hotel staff."
"Let us ensure our public places are clean and tidy! Let us also ensure we remain fit and
healthy," he tweeted.
iA foundation with 42.1 and AMC organised the first plogging drive in Ahmedabad on 26th
May 2019. Plogging means picking up trash, such as used plastic bottles while jogging or
running.</p>

                <p class="p-size">DA-IICT Gandhinagar organized a 7 KM long run, supported by iA Foundation. The inspiration for the
run was to provide the youth with an opportunity to voice their opinions on issues that are close to
the society while keeping their health at the center. With the theme of #HumFitTohIndiaFit, the event
was inaugurated by the Shri D.D. Kapadiya Sir - Secretary of Sports Authority of Gujarat (SAG) and
Mayor of Gandhinagar. More than 700 people across the city participated in the event, and we hope
that all the participants leave the race today with an increased appreciation for our environment and
will continue to push the boundaries to adopt a healthy and sustainable lifestyle in their daily lives.
Only then can we be future-ready together."</p>

clean-up hikes at Thangadh, Jessore Sanctuary, and Amirgadh. The purpose was to clean
up the identified litter-spots and collect the trash while hiking. Participants also performed
hiking and scrambling during specific sessions to strengthen their connections with
outdoors and wild grounds. As a team, they collected approximately 550 to 570 kgs of
separate solid waste, especially plastic, metal, and glass from these outdoors. More than
ten iA employees were part of this movement to raise local awareness and implement
lasting changes to end the waste epidemic once and for all at these specific locations.</p>

                  <p class="p-size">It has just been a year that I’ve been working at infoAnalytica. One of the things I admire about the
work culture is their belief in giving back to society. Working at iA, I got an opportunity to volunteer as
well as lead some of the CSR activities, and that was an experience of my life. I volunteered in
activities like Beat the Heat, Plogging event, and many others. I have felt the inner joy and happiness
by helping the people who were needy and wanted some help. I still recall the day when I to distribute
the mango juice as a part of Beat the heat event, children at streets came to drink it, and they got so
happy. I can never forget that innocent smiling face in my life. That was an enjoyable experience.
Thank you, CSR team, for letting me be a part of these activities
