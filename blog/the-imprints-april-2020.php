                <p class="p-size">
Welcome to the COVID 19 edition of 'The Imprints,' our CSR newsletter designed especially for iA employees, our
partners, and affiliates. This edition of ‘The Imprints’ would speak about the initiatives which we have undertaken
during the pandemic lockdown for the society, collaborations with various stakeholders, NGOs and corporates and
our Founder’s message.
</p>
                <p class="p-size">
We will also highlight the contributions of our employees and affiliates, who are volunteering and contributing to
our initiatives in building equitable and sustainable communities.
</p>
                <p class="p-size">
I want to thank Amit Gupta, Founder – infoAnalytica, and everyone from the team for their everlasting support
throughout our activities and initiatives, and in everything that we do!</p>

                <p class="p-size">"Corona." The word after every few ones these days. And it's been some weeks now. While we are locked
down and have WFH or enough ration or Netflix shows buffered. We didn't stop thinking about the maids,
laundry guy, hawkers, daily wagers, laborers, migrants, or older people. A small step towards this led to a
marathon of activities, and we feel relatively content. The best part has been helping and support coming
from various individuals, organizations, Corporates, AMC, and the Police team. We have been able to provide
meals, ration kit, and tea service to about 1,00,000 people and counting in the city. Have raised funds to get
this going, built a team of volunteers, tracking it geographically, sharing stories, and will continue this till we
can. A shout out to The Ahmedabad Project, Foodaholics in Ahmedabad, Sante Spa, VSSM, Hi-tech
outsourcing, RHA, Radio 104 and more for trusting and collaborating with us. And most of all, the iAeans for
your constant backing.</p>

                <p class="p-size" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px;">It is only now that we are aware of the hardships that a migrant worker, a slum dweller, a safai
karamchari, security guards or your housemaid faces. The struggle for their wages, food, health has
now started affecting us and the society around. iA Foundation thought of distributing Ration Kits to
the underprivileged community deprived of food. These food kit contains our daily essentials like
(Rice, Atta, Sugar, Tea, Oil, and other commodities). One food kit serves a family of four for at-least
ten days.<br>

                <p class="p-size" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 0px;" align="right">As the city wears a deserted look, it is hard to even find the chai walas, the suppliers of fuel to that
makes Ahmedabad run. They say 70% of the human body is water, we think in case of the average
Gujarati, it is 50% chai. This is our small homage in collaboration with Te.Cha to those still out there
working for our city - the traffic cops, the street vendors selling vegetables, the safai karamcharis and
yes, the homeless and daily wagers wherever we find them. </p>

                <p class="p-size" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px;"><b>"Food is not just fuel. Food is about community; food is about identity".</b>
With the help of Sante Spa Cuisine and Robinhood Army, we were able to serve cooked meals to more
than 500+ people on daily basis. We are also supporting three community kitchens in Ahmedabad and
one in Bikaner (Rajasthan) which prepares meals for more than 1500+ people on daily basis
respectively
